Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic", they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nosebleeds

Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder (thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder
